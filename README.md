The HDSS will provide real-time clinical decision support. The system predicts diseases based on patient symptoms and recommends medication, precautions, workouts, and diet.
The model will be trained on various algorithms like Support Vector Classifier, Random forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, etc to find the optimal one.
